# Vue-Bulma-Starter

A simple ES6 Vue.js starter that uses the gorgeous [Bulma.io](http://bulma.io/)  CSS framework and Webpack. 

Uses SASS
out of the box, but can easily be switched to SCSS. Based off of  [vue-loader](http://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).

## Build Setup

``` bash
# After cloning, navigate to root and install dependencies
npm install
# Compile SASS and Serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev-build

# build for production with minification
npm run build
```
